# Zach Hensler's homepage.

## Summary

This page was designed to serve as a living resume, an example of what my Front End capabilities are.  While also shedding 
some light on my personality/interests.

Some of the more interesting points of this project in my opinion are:
<ul>
    <li>The custom navigation hook `src/hooks/useNavigation.tsx`</li>
    <li>The "ShowMe" page `src/workflows/ShowMe.tsx`</li>
    <li>The "All Natural" use of CSS to create a lightweight page</li>
</ul>
